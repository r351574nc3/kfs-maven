 * implements a type to hold the raw SQL for each step in a process.  allows us to have an insertion point for system parameters which can only be 
 * incorporated into the SQL at run-time.  provides a method to insert the parameter string and return the finished SQL as a string,
 * and another to just return SQL as a string without inserting anything, therefore permitting most of the SQL to be built in a constructor and finished at run time.
