 * decimal value and the calculation results carry past the expected decimals and if the next decimal value is greater than or equal
 * to 5, the last decimal value will be incremented by 1. - If the calculation results carry past the expected decimals and if the
 * next decimal value is less than 5, the last decimal value will not be incremented.
